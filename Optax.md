A gradient processing and optimization library for [[JAX|JAX]].
Optax facilitates research by providing building blocks that can be
recombined in custom ways to optimize parametric models such as
deep neural networks. Other goals include:

<ul>
<li>Providing readable, well-tested, efficient implementations of
core components.</li>
<li>Improving productivity by making it possible to combine low level ingredients
into custom optimizers (or other gradient processing components).</li>
<li>Accelerating adoption of new ideas by making it easy for anyone
to contribute.</li>
</ul>
