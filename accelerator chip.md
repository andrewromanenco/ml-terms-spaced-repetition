A category of specialized hardware components designed to perform key
computations needed for deep learning algorithms.

Accelerator chips (or just <strong>accelerators</strong>, for short) can significantly
increase the speed and efficiency of training and inference tasks
compared to a general-purpose CPU. They are ideal for training
neural networks and similar computationally intensive tasks.

Examples of accelerator chips include:

<ul>
<li>Google&#39;s Tensor Processing Units ([[TPU|TPUs]]) with dedicated hardware
for deep learning.</li>
<li>NVIDIA&#39;s GPUs which, though initially designed for graphics processing,
are designed to enable parallel processing, which can significantly
increase processing speed.</li>
</ul>
