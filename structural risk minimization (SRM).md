An algorithm that balances two goals:

<ul>
<li>The need to build the most predictive model (for example, lowest loss).</li>
<li>The need to keep the model as simple as possible (for example, strong
regularization).</li>
</ul>

For example, a function that minimizes loss+regularization on the
training set is a structural risk minimization algorithm.

Contrast with [[empirical risk minimization (ERM)|empirical risk minimization]].
