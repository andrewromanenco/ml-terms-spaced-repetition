A derivative in which all but one of the variables is considered a constant.
For example, the partial derivative of <em>f(x, y)</em> with respect to <em>x</em> is the
derivative of <em>f</em> considered as a function of <em>x</em> alone (that is, keeping <em>y</em>
constant). The partial derivative of <em>f</em> with respect to <em>x</em> focuses only on
how <em>x</em> is changing and ignores all other variables in the equation.
