A [[model|model]] used as a reference point for comparing how well another
model (typically, a more complex one) is performing. For example, a
[[logistic regression|logistic regression model]] might serve as a
good baseline for a [[deep model|deep model]].

For a particular problem, the baseline helps model developers quantify
the minimal expected performance that a new model must achieve for the new
model to be useful.
