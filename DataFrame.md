A popular [[pandas|pandas]] data type for representing
[[data set or dataset|datasets]] in memory.

A DataFrame is analogous to a table or a spreadsheet. Each column of
a DataFrame has a name (a header), and each row is identified by a
unique number.

Each column in a DataFrame is structured like a 2D array, except that
each column can be assigned its own data type.
