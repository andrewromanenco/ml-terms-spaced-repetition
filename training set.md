The subset of the [[data set or dataset|dataset]] used to train a [[model|model]].

Traditionally, examples in the dataset are divided into the following three
distinct subsets:

<ul>
<li>a training set</li>
<li>a [[validation set|validation set]]</li>
<li>a [[test set|test set]]</li>
</ul>

Ideally, each example in the dataset should belong to only one of the
preceding subsets. For example, a single example shouldn&#39;t belong to
both the training set and the validation set.
