Processing data before it&#39;s used to train a model. Preprocessing could
be as simple as removing words from an English text corpus that don&#39;t
occur in the English dictionary, or could be as complex as re-expressing
data points in a way that eliminates as many attributes that are correlated
with [[sensitive attribute|sensitive attributes]] as possible.
Preprocessing can help satisfy [[fairness constraint|fairness constraints]].
