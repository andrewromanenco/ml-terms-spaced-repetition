[[representation|Representing]] each word in a word set within an
[[embedding vector|embedding vector]]; that is, representing each word as
a vector of floating-point values between 0.0 and 1.0. Words with similar
meanings have more-similar representations than words with different meanings.
For example, <em>carrots</em>, <em>celery</em>, and <em>cucumbers</em> would all have relatively
similar representations, which would be very different from the representations
of <em>airplane</em>, <em>sunglasses</em>, and <em>toothpaste</em>.
