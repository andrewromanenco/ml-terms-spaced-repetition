The idea that averaging the opinions or estimates of a large group
of people (&quot;the crowd&quot;) often produces surprisingly good results.
For example, consider a game in which people guess the number of
jelly beans packed into a large jar. Although most individual
guesses will be inaccurate, the average of all the guesses has been
empirically shown to be surprisingly close to the actual number of
jelly beans in the jar.

[[ensemble|Ensembles]] are a software analog of wisdom of the crowd.
Even if individual models make wildly inaccurate predictions,
averaging the predictions of many models often generates surprisingly
good predictions. For example, although an individual
[[decision tree|decision tree]] might make poor predictions, a
[[decision forest|decision forest]] often makes very good predictions.
