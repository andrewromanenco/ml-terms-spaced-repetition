A [[neural network|neural network]] in which at least one layer is a
[[convolutional layer|convolutional layer]]. A typical convolutional
neural network consists of some combination of the following layers:

<ul>
<li>[[convolutional layer|convolutional layers]]</li>
<li>[[pooling|pooling layers]]</li>
<li>[[dense layer|dense layers]]</li>
</ul>

Convolutional neural networks have had great success in certain kinds
of problems, such as image recognition.
