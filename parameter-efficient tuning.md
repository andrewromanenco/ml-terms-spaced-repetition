A set of techniques to [[fine tuning|fine-tune]] a large
[[pre-trained model|pre-trained language model (PLM)]]
more efficiently than full [[fine tuning|fine-tuning]]. Parameter-efficient
tuning typically fine-tunes far fewer [[parameter|parameters]] than full
fine-tuning, yet generally produces a
[[large language model|large language model]] that performs
as well (or almost as well) as a large language model built from full
fine-tuning.
