#fundamentals

A plot of both [[training loss|training loss]] and
[[validation loss|validation loss]] as a function of the number of
[[iteration|iterations]].

A generalization curve can help you detect possible
[[overfitting|overfitting]]. For example, the following
generalization curve suggests overfitting because validation loss
ultimately becomes significantly higher than training loss.
