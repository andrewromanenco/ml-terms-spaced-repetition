An intercept or offset from an origin. Bias is a parameter in
machine learning models, which is symbolized by either of the
following:

<ul>
<li><i>b</i></li>
<li><i>w<sub>0</sub></i></li>
</ul>

For example, bias is the <em>b</em> in the following formula:

<div>
$$y' = b + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + â€¦ w_nx_n$$
</div>

In a simple two-dimensional line, bias just means &quot;y-intercept.&quot;
For example, the bias of the line in the following illustration is 2.

Bias exists because not all models start from the origin (0,0). For example,
suppose an amusement park costs 2 Euros to enter and an additional
0.5 Euro for every hour a customer stays. Therefore, a model mapping the
total cost has a bias of 2 because the lowest cost is 2 Euros.

Bias is not to be confused with [[bias (ethics_fairness)|bias in ethics and fairness]]
or [[prediction bias|prediction bias]].
