#language, #generativeAI

An optional part of a [[prompt|prompt]] that identifies a target audience
for a [[generative AI|generative AI]] model&#39;s response. <em>Without</em> a role
prompt, a large language model provides an answer that may or may not be useful
for the person asking the questions. <em>With</em> a role prompt, a large language
model can answer in a way that&#39;s more appropriate and more helpful for a
specific target audience. For example, the role prompt portion of the following
prompts are in boldface:

<ul>
<li>Summarize this article <strong>for a PhD in economics</strong>.</li>
<li>Describe how tides work <strong>for a ten-year old</strong>.</li>
<li>Explain the 2008 financial crisis. <strong>Speak as you might to a young child,
or a golden retriever.</strong></li>
</ul>
