An efficient notation for describing how two [[Tensor|tensors]] are to be
combined. The tensors are combined by multiplying the elements of one tensor
by the elements of the other tensor and then summing the products.
Einsum notation uses symbols to identify the axes of each tensor, and those
same symbols are rearranged to specify the shape of the new resulting tensor.

[[NumPy|NumPy]] provides a common Einsum implementation.
