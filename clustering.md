#clustering

Grouping related [[example|examples]], particularly during
[[unsupervised machine learning|unsupervised learning]]. Once all the
examples are grouped, a human can optionally supply meaning to each cluster.

Many clustering algorithms exist. For example, the [[k-means|k-means]]
algorithm clusters examples based on their proximity to a
[[centroid|centroid]], as in the following diagram:

A human researcher could then review the clusters and, for example,
label cluster 1 as &quot;dwarf trees&quot; and cluster 2 as &quot;full-size trees.&quot;

As another example, consider a clustering algorithm based on an
example&#39;s distance from a center point, illustrated as follows:
