A machine learning technique in which a single [[model|model]] is
trained to perform multiple [[task|tasks]].

Multitask models are created by training on data that is appropriate for
each of the different tasks. This allows the model to learn to share
information across the tasks, which helps the model learn more effectively.

A model trained for multiple tasks often has improved generalization abilities
and can be more robust at handling different types of data.
