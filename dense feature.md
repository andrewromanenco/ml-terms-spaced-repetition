#fundamentals

A [[feature|feature]] in which most or all values are nonzero, typically
a [[Tensor|Tensor]] of floating-point values. For example, the following
10-element Tensor is dense because 9 of its values are nonzero:

<table>
  <tr> <td>8</td> <td>3</td> <td>7</td> <td>5</td> <td>2</td>
       <td>4</td> <td>0</td> <td>4</td> <td>9</td> <td>6</td> </tr>
</table>

Contrast with [[sparse feature|sparse feature]].
