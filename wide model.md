A linear model that typically has many
[[sparse feature|sparse input features]]. We refer to it as &quot;wide&quot; since
such a model is a special type of [[neural network|neural network]] with a
large number of inputs that connect directly to the output node. Wide models
are often easier to debug and inspect than [[deep model|deep models]].
Although wide models
cannot express nonlinearities through [[hidden layer|hidden layers]],
wide models can use transformations such as
[[feature cross|feature crossing]] and
[[bucketing|bucketization]] to model nonlinearities in different ways.

Contrast with [[deep model|deep model]].
