A probabilistic [[neural network|neural network]] that accounts for
uncertainty in [[weight|weights]] and outputs. A standard neural network
regression model typically [[prediction|predicts]] a scalar value;
for example, a standard model predicts a house price
of 853,000. In contrast, a Bayesian neural network predicts a distribution of
values; for example, a Bayesian model predicts a house price of 853,000 with
a standard deviation of 67,200.

A Bayesian neural network relies on

to calculate uncertainties in weights and predictions. A Bayesian neural
network can be useful when it is important to quantify uncertainty, such as in
models related to pharmaceuticals. Bayesian neural networks can also help
prevent [[overfitting|overfitting]].
