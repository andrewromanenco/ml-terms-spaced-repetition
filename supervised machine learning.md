Training a [[model|model]] from [[feature|features]] and their
corresponding [[label|labels]]. Supervised machine learning is analogous
to learning a subject by studying a set of questions and their
corresponding answers. After mastering the mapping between questions and
answers, a student can then provide answers to new (never-before-seen)
questions on the same topic.
