#fairness

Making decisions about people that impact different population
subgroups disproportionately. This usually refers to situations
where an algorithmic decision-making process harms or benefits
some subgroups more than others.

For example, suppose an algorithm that determines a Lilliputian&#39;s
eligibility for a miniature-home loan is more likely to classify
them as &quot;ineligible&quot; if their mailing address contains a certain
postal code. If Big-Endian Lilliputians are more likely to have
mailing addresses with this postal code than Little-Endian Lilliputians,
then this algorithm may result in disparate impact.

Contrast with [[disparate treatment|disparate treatment]],
which focuses on disparities that result when subgroup characteristics
are explicit inputs to an algorithmic decision-making process.
