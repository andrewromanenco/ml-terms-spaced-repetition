Training a model on data where some of the training examples have labels but
others don&#39;t. One technique for semi-supervised learning is to infer labels for
the unlabeled examples, and then to train on the inferred labels to create a new
model. Semi-supervised learning can be useful if labels are expensive to obtain
but unlabeled examples are plentiful.

[[self-training|Self-training]] is one technique for semi-supervised
learning.
