A loss function for
[[generative adversarial network (GAN)|generative adversarial networks]],
based on the [[cross-entropy|cross-entropy]] between the distribution
of generated data and real data.

Minimax loss is used in the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf">first paper</a> to describe
generative adversarial networks.
