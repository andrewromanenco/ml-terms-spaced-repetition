A [[hyperparameter|hyperparameter]] in
[[gradient boosting|gradient boosting]] that controls
[[overfitting|overfitting]]. Shrinkage in gradient boosting
is analogous to [[learning rate|learning rate]] in
[[gradient descent|gradient descent]]. Shrinkage is a decimal
value between 0.0 and 1.0. A lower shrinkage value reduces overfitting
more than a larger shrinkage value.
