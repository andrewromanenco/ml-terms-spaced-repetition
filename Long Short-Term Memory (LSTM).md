#seq

A type of cell in a
[[recurrent neural network|recurrent neural network]] used to process
sequences of data in applications such as handwriting recognition, machine
translation, and image captioning. LSTMs address the
[[vanishing gradient problem|vanishing gradient problem]] that occurs when
training RNNs due to long data sequences by maintaining history in an
internal memory state based on new input and context from previous cells
in the RNN.
