#fundamentals

An example that contains one or more [[feature|features]] and a
[[label|label]]. For example, the following table shows three
labeled examples from a house valuation model, each with three features
and one label:

<table>
  <tr><th>Number of bedrooms</th> <th>Number of bathrooms</th>
      <th>House age</th> <th>House price (label)</th></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td> <td>2</td> <td>15</td> <td>$345,000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td> <td>1</td> <td>72</td> <td>$179,000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td> <td>2</td> <td>34</td> <td>$392,000</td></tr>
</table>

models train on labeled examples and make predictions on

Contrast labeled example with unlabeled examples.
