#fundamentals

A feature whose values change across one or more dimensions, usually time.
For example, consider the following examples of nonstationarity:

<ul>
<li>The number of swimsuits sold at a particular store varies with the season.</li>
<li>The quantity of a particular fruit harvested in a particular region
is zero for much of the year but large for a brief period.</li>
<li>Due to climate change, annual mean temperatures are shifting.</li>
</ul>

Contrast with [[stationarity|stationarity]].
