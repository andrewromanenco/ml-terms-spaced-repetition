#TensorFlow

A large-scale, distributed, machine learning platform. The term also refers to
the base API layer in the TensorFlow stack, which supports general computation
on dataflow graphs.

Although TensorFlow is primarily used for machine learning, you may also use
TensorFlow for non-ML tasks that require numerical computation using
dataflow graphs.
