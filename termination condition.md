In [[reinforcement learning (RL)|reinforcement learning]], the conditions that
determine when an [[episode|episode]] ends, such as when the agent reaches
a certain state or exceeds a threshold number of state transitions.
For example, in <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">tic-tac-toe</a> (also
known as noughts and crosses), an episode terminates either when a player marks
three consecutive spaces or when all spaces are marked.
