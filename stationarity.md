#fundamentals

A feature whose values don&#39;t change across one or more dimensions, usually time.
For example, a feature whose values look about the same in 2021 and
2023 exhibits stationarity.

In the real world, very few features exhibit stationarity. Even features
synonymous with stability (like sea level) change over time.

Contrast with [[nonstationarity|nonstationarity]].
