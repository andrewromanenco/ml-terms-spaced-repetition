A distributed machine learning approach that [[training|trains]]
machine learning [[model|models]] using decentralized
[[example|examples]] residing on devices such as smartphones.
In federated learning, a subset of devices downloads the current model
from a central coordinating server. The devices use the examples stored
on the devices to make improvements to the model. The devices then upload
the model improvements (but not the training examples) to the coordinating
server, where they are aggregated with other updates to yield an improved
global model. After the aggregation, the model updates computed by devices
are no longer needed, and can be discarded.

Since the training examples are never uploaded, federated learning follows the
privacy principles of focused data collection and data minimization.
