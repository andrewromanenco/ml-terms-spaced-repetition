#fundamentals

An input variable to a machine learning model. An [[example|example]]
consists of one or more features. For instance, suppose you are training a
model to determine the influence of weather conditions on student test scores.
The following table shows three examples, each of which contains
three features and one label:

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="3">Features</th> <th>Label</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Temperature</th> <th>Humidity</th> <th>Pressure</th>
      <th>Test score </th></tr>
  <tr><td>15</td> <td>47</td> <td>998</td> <td>92</td></tr>
  <tr><td>19</td> <td>34</td> <td>1020</td> <td>84</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18</td> <td>92</td> <td>1012</td> <td>87</td></tr>
</table>

Contrast with [[label|label]].
