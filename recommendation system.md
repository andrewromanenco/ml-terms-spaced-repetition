#recsystems

A system that selects for each user a relatively small set of desirable
[[items|items]] from a large corpus.
For example, a video recommendation system might recommend two videos
from a corpus of 100,000 videos, selecting <em>Casablanca</em> and
<em>The Philadelphia Story</em> for one user, and <em>Wonder Woman</em> and
<em>Black Panther</em> for another. A video recommendation system might
base its recommendations on factors such as:

<ul>
<li>Movies that similar users have rated or watched.</li>
<li>Genre, directors, actors, target demographic...</li>
</ul>
