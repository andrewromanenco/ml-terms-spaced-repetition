#language

In general, any ML system that converts from a processed, dense, or
internal representation to a more raw, sparse, or external representation.

Decoders are often a component of a larger model, where they are frequently
paired with an [[encoder|encoder]].

In [[sequence-to-sequence task|sequence-to-sequence tasks]], a decoder
starts with the internal state generated by the encoder to predict the next
sequence.

Refer to [[Transformer|Transformer]] for the definition of a decoder within
the Transformer architecture.
