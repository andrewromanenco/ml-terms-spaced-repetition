A [[probabilistic regression model|probabilistic regression model]]
technique for optimizing computationally expensive
[[objective function|objective functions]] by instead optimizing a surrogate
that quantifies the uncertainty using a Bayesian learning technique. Since
Bayesian optimization is itself very expensive, it is usually used to optimize
expensive-to-evaluate tasks that have a small number of parameters, such as
selecting [[hyperparameter|hyperparameters]].
