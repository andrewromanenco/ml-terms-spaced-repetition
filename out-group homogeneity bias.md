#fairness

The tendency to see out-group members as more alike than in-group members
when comparing attitudes, values, personality traits, and other
characteristics. <strong>In-group</strong> refers to people you interact with regularly;
<strong>out-group</strong> refers to people you don&#39;t interact with regularly. If you
create a dataset by asking people to provide attributes about
out-groups, those attributes may be less nuanced and more stereotyped
than attributes that participants list for people in their in-group.

For example, Lilliputians might describe the houses of other Lilliputians
in great detail, citing small differences in architectural styles, windows,
doors, and sizes. However, the same Lilliputians might simply declare that
Brobdingnagians all live in identical houses.

Out-group homogeneity bias is a form of
