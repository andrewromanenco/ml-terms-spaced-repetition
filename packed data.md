An approach for storing data more efficiently.

Packed data stores data either by using a compressed format or in
some other way that allows it to be accessed more efficiently.
Packed data minimizes the amount of memory and computation required to
access it, leading to faster training and more efficient model inference.

Packed data is often used with other techniques, such as
[[data augmentation|data augmentation]] and
[[regularization|regularization]], further improving the performance of
[[model|models]].
