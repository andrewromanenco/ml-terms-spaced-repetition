#fundamentals

The variables that you or a hyperparameter tuning service

adjust during successive runs of training a model. For example,
[[learning rate|learning rate]] is a hyperparameter. You could
set the learning rate to 0.01 before one training session. If you
determine that 0.01 is too high, you could perhaps set the learning
rate to 0.003 for the next training session.

In contrast, [[parameter|parameters]] are the various
[[weight|weights]] and [[bias (math) or bias term|bias]] that the model
<em>learns</em> during training.
