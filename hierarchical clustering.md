#clustering

A category of [[clustering|clustering]] algorithms that create a tree
of clusters. Hierarchical clustering is well-suited to hierarchical data,
such as botanical taxonomies. There are two types of hierarchical
clustering algorithms:

<ul>
<li><strong>Agglomerative clustering</strong> first assigns every example to its own cluster,
and iteratively merges the closest clusters to create a hierarchical
tree.</li>
<li><strong>Divisive clustering</strong> first groups all examples into one cluster and then
iteratively divides the cluster into a hierarchical tree.</li>
</ul>

Contrast with [[centroid-based clustering|centroid-based clustering]].
