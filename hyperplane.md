A boundary that separates a space into two subspaces. For example, a line is a
hyperplane in two dimensions and a plane is a hyperplane in three dimensions.
More typically in machine learning, a hyperplane is the boundary separating a
high-dimensional space. [[Kernel Support Vector Machines (KSVMs)|Kernel Support Vector Machines]] use
hyperplanes to separate positive classes from negative classes, often in a very
high-dimensional space.
