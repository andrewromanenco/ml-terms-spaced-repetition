In [[recommendation system|recommendation systems]], a
matrix of [[embedding vector|embedding vectors]] generated by
[[matrix factorization|matrix factorization]]
that holds latent signals about each [[items|item]].
Each row of the item matrix holds the value of a single latent
feature for all items.
For example, consider a movie recommendation system. Each column
in the item matrix represents a single movie. The latent signals
might represent genres, or might be harder-to-interpret
signals that involve complex interactions among genre, stars,
movie age, or other factors.

The item matrix has the same number of columns as the target
matrix that is being factorized. For example, given a movie
recommendation system that evaluates 10,000 movie titles, the
item matrix will have 10,000 columns.
