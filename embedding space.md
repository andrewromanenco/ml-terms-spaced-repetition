The d-dimensional vector space that features from a higher-dimensional
vector space are mapped to. Ideally, the embedding space contains a
structure that yields meaningful mathematical results; for example,
in an ideal embedding space, addition and subtraction of embeddings
can solve word analogy tasks.

The <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product" target="T">dot product</a>
of two embeddings is a measure of their similarity.
