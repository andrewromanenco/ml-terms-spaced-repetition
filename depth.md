#fundamentals

The sum of the following in a [[neural network|neural network]]:

<ul>
<li>the number of [[hidden layer|hidden layers]]</li>
<li>the number of [[output layer|output layers]], which is typically 1</li>
<li>the number of any [[embedding layer|embedding layers]]</li>
</ul>

For example, a neural network with five hidden layers and one output layer
has a depth of 6.

Notice that the [[input layer|input layer]] doesn&#39;t
influence depth.
