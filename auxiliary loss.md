A [[loss function|loss function]]—used in conjunction with a
[[neural network|neural network]] [[model|model&#39;s]] main
loss function—that helps accelerate [[training|training]] during the
early iterations when weights are randomly initialized.

Auxiliary loss functions push effective [[gradient|gradients]]
to the earlier [[layer|layers]]. This facilitates
[[convergence|convergence]] during [[training|training]]
by combating the [[vanishing gradient problem|vanishing gradient problem]].
