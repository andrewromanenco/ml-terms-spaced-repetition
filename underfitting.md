Producing a [[model|model]] with poor predictive ability because the model
hasn&#39;t fully captured the complexity of the training data. Many problems
can cause underfitting, including:

<ul>
<li>Training on the wrong set of [[feature|features]].</li>
<li>Training for too few [[epoch|epochs]] or at too low
a [[learning rate|learning rate]].</li>
<li>Training with too high a [[regularization rate|regularization rate]].</li>
<li>Providing too few [[hidden layer|hidden layers]] in a
deep neural network.</li>
</ul>
