Distributing a feature&#39;s values into [[bucketing|buckets]] so that each
bucket contains the same (or almost the same) number of examples. For example,
the following figure divides 44 points into 4 buckets, each of which
contains 11 points. In order for each bucket in the figure to contain the
same number of points, some buckets span a different width of x-values.
