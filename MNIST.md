#image

A public-domain dataset compiled by LeCun, Cortes, and Burges containing
60,000 images, each image showing how a human manually wrote a particular
digit from 0â€“9. Each image is stored as a 28x28 array of integers, where
each integer is a grayscale value between 0 and 255, inclusive.

MNIST is a canonical dataset for machine learning, often used to test new
machine learning approaches. For details, see
