A function that identifies the frequency of data samples having <em>exactly</em> a
particular value. When a dataset&#39;s values are continuous floating-point
numbers, exact matches rarely occur. However, <em>integrating</em> a probability
density function from value <code translate="no" dir="ltr">x</code> to value <code translate="no" dir="ltr">y</code> yields the expected frequency of
data samples between <code translate="no" dir="ltr">x</code> and <code translate="no" dir="ltr">y</code>.

For example, consider a normal distribution having a mean of 200 and a
standard deviation of 30. To determine the expected frequency of data samples
falling within the range 211.4 to 218.7, you can integrate the probability
density function for a normal distribution from 211.4 to 218.7.
