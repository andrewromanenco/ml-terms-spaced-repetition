In reinforcement learning, the world that contains the [[agent|agent]]
and allows the agent to observe that world&#39;s [[state|state]]. For example,
the represented world can be a game like chess, or a physical world like a
maze. When the agent applies an [[action|action]] to the environment,
then the environment transitions between states.
