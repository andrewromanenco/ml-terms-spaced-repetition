A type of [[machine learning|machine learning]] algorithm that
improves the [[performance|performance]] of a [[model|model]]
by combining the [[prediction|predictions]] of multiple models and
using those predictions to make a single prediction. As a result,
a loss aggregator can reduce the variance of the predictions and
improve the [[accuracy|accuracy]] of the predictions.
