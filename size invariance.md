#image

In an image classification problem, an algorithm&#39;s ability to successfully
classify images even when the size of the image changes. For example,
the algorithm can still identify a
cat whether it consumes 2M pixels or 200K pixels. Note that even the best
image classification algorithms still have practical limits on size invariance.
For example, an algorithm (or human) is unlikely to correctly classify a
cat image consuming only 20 pixels.
