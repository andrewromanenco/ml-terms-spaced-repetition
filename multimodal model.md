A model whose inputs and/or outputs include more than one
[[modality|modality]]. For example, consider a model that takes both an
image and a text caption (two modalities) as [[feature|features]], and
outputs a score indicating how appropriate the text caption is for the image.
So, this model&#39;s inputs are multimodal and the output is unimodal.
