A family of algorithms that learn an optimal [[policy|policy]], whose goal
is to maximize [[return|return]] when interacting with
an [[environment|environment]].
For example, the ultimate reward of most games is victory.
Reinforcement learning systems can become expert at playing complex
games by evaluating sequences of previous game moves that ultimately
led to wins and sequences that ultimately led to losses.
