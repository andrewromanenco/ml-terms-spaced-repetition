Transferring information from one machine learning task to another.
For example, in multi-task learning, a single model solves multiple tasks,
such as a [[deep model|deep model]] that has different output nodes for
different tasks. Transfer learning might involve transferring knowledge
from the solution of a simpler task to a more complex one, or involve
transferring knowledge from a task where there is more data to one where
there is less data.

Most machine learning systems solve a <em>single</em> task. Transfer learning is a
baby step towards artificial intelligence in which a single program can solve
<em>multiple</em> tasks.
