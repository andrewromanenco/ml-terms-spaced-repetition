#clustering, #fundamentals

Training a [[model|model]] to find patterns in a dataset, typically an
unlabeled dataset.

The most common use of unsupervised machine learning is to
[[clustering|cluster]] data
into groups of similar examples. For example, an unsupervised machine
learning algorithm can cluster songs based on various properties
of the music. The resulting clusters can become an input to other machine
learning algorithms (for example, to a music recommendation service).
Clustering can help when useful labels are scarce or absent.
For example, in domains such as anti-abuse and fraud, clusters can help
humans better understand the data.

Contrast with [[supervised machine learning|supervised machine learning]].

Another example of unsupervised machine learning is

For example, applying PCA on a
dataset containing the contents of millions of shopping carts might reveal
that shopping carts containing lemons frequently also contain antacids.
