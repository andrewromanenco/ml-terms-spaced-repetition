#fundamentals

Data drawn from a distribution that doesn&#39;t change, and where each value
drawn doesn&#39;t depend on values that have been drawn previously. An i.i.d.
is the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas" target="T">ideal gas</a>
of machine
learningâ€”a useful mathematical construct but almost never exactly found
in the real world. For example, the distribution of visitors to a web page
may be i.i.d. over a brief window of time; that is, the distribution doesn&#39;t
change during that brief window and one person&#39;s visit is generally
independent of another&#39;s visit. However, if you expand that window of time,
seasonal differences in the web page&#39;s visitors may appear.
