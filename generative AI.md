#language, #image, #generativeAI

An emerging transformative field with no formal definition.
That said, most experts agree that generative AI models can
create (&quot;generate&quot;) content that is all of the following:

<ul>
<li>complex</li>
<li>coherent</li>
<li>original</li>
</ul>

For example, a generative AI model can create sophisticated
essays or images.

Some earlier technologies, including [[Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)|LSTMs]]
and [[recurrent neural network|RNNs]], can also generate original and
coherent content. Some experts view these earlier technologies as
generative AI, while others feel that true generative AI requires more complex
output than those earlier technologies can produce.

Contrast with [[predictive ML|predictive ML]].
