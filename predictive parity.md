#fairness

A [[fairness metric|fairness metric]] that checks whether,
for a given classifier, the [[precision|precision]] rates
are equivalent for subgroups under consideration.

For example, a model that predicts college acceptance would satisfy
predictive parity for nationality if its precision rate is the same
for Lilliputians and Brobdingnagians.

Predictive parity is sometime also called <em>predictive rate parity</em>.

Explained&quot;</a> (section 3.2.1)
for a more detailed discussion of predictive parity.
