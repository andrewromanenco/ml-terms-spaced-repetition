A statistical way of comparing two (or more) techniquesâ€”the <em>A</em>
and the <em>B</em>. Typically, the <em>A</em> is an existing technique, and the
<em>B</em> is a new technique.
A/B testing not only determines which technique performs better
but also whether the difference is statistically significant.

A/B testing usually compares a single [[metric|metric]] on two techniques;
for example, how does model [[accuracy|accuracy]] compare for two
techniques? However, A/B testing can also compare any finite number of
metrics.
