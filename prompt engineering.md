The art of creating [[prompt|prompts]] that elicit the desired responses
from a [[large language model|large language model]]. Humans perform prompt
engineering. Writing well-structured prompts is an essential part of ensuring
useful responses from a large language model. Prompt engineering depends on
many factors, including:

<ul>
<li>The dataset used to [[pre-training|pre-train]] and possibly
[[fine tuning|fine-tune]] the large language model.</li>
<li>The [[temperature|temperature]] and other decoding parameters that the
model uses to generate responses.</li>
</ul>
