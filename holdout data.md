[[example|Examples]] intentionally not used (&quot;held out&quot;) during training.
The [[validation set|validation dataset]] and
[[test set|test dataset]] are examples of holdout data. Holdout data
helps evaluate your model&#39;s ability to generalize to data other than the
data it was trained on. The loss on the holdout set provides a better
estimate of the loss on an unseen dataset than does the loss on the
training set.
