In machine learning, a distinct unit within a [[hidden layer|hidden layer]]
of a [[neural network|neural network]]. Each neuron performs the following
two-step action:

<ol>
<li>Calculates the [[weighted sum|weighted sum]] of input values multiplied
by their corresponding weights.</li>
<li>Passes the weighted sum as input to an
[[activation function|activation function]].</li>
</ol>

A neuron in the first hidden layer accepts inputs from the feature values
in the [[input layer|input layer]]. A neuron in any hidden layer beyond
the first accepts inputs from the neurons in the preceding hidden layer.
For example, a neuron in the second hidden layer accepts inputs from the
neurons in the first hidden layer.

The following illustration highlights two neurons and their
inputs.

A neuron in a neural network mimics the behavior of neurons in brains and
other parts of nervous systems.
