The frequency and range of different values for a given
[[feature|feature]] or [[label|label]].
A distribution captures how likely a particular value is.

The following image shows histograms of two different distributions:

<ul>
<li>On the left, a power law distribution of wealth versus the number of people
possessing that wealth.</li>
<li>On the right, a normal distribution of height versus the number of people
possessing that height.</li>
</ul>

Understanding each feature and label&#39;s distribution can help you determine how
to [[normalization|normalize]] values and detect [[outliers|outliers]].

The phrase <strong>out of distribution</strong> refers to a value that doesn&#39;t appear in the
dataset or is very rare. For example, an image of the planet Saturn would be
considered out of distribution for a dataset consisting of cat images.
