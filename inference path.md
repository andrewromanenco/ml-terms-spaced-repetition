In a [[decision tree|decision tree]], during [[inference|inference]],
the route a particular [[example|example]] takes from the
[[root|root]] to other [[condition|conditions]], terminating with
a [[leaf|leaf]]. For instance, in the following decision tree, the
thicker arrows show the inference path for an example with the following
feature values:

<ul>
<li>x = 7</li>
<li>y = 12</li>
<li>z = -3</li>
</ul>

The inference path in the following illustration travels through three
conditions before reaching the leaf (<code translate="no" dir="ltr">Zeta</code>).

          inference path travels from the root to the next condition (y > 0).
          Since the answer is Yes, the inference path then travels to the
          next condition (z > 0). Since the answer is No, the inference path
          travels to its terminal node, which is the leaf (Zeta)."
