The initial training of a model on a large dataset. Some pre-trained models
are clumsy giants and must typically be refined through additional training.
For example, ML experts might pre-train a
[[large language model|large language model]] on a vast text dataset,
such as all the English pages in Wikipedia. Following pre-training, the
resulting model might be further refined through any of the following
techniques:

<ul>
<li>[[distillation|distillation]]</li>
<li>[[fine tuning|fine-tuning]]</li>
<li>[[instruction tuning|instruction tuning]]</li>
<li>[[parameter-efficient tuning|parameter-efficient tuning]]</li>
<li>[[prompt tuning|prompt-tuning]]</li>
</ul>
