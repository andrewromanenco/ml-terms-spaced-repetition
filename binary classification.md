#fundamentals

A type of [[classification model|classification]] task that
predicts one of two mutually exclusive classes:

<ul>
<li>the [[positive class|positive class]]</li>
<li>the [[negative class|negative class]]</li>
</ul>

For example, the following two machine learning models each perform
binary classification:

<ul>
<li>A model that determines whether email messages are
<em>spam</em> (the positive class) or <em>not spam</em> (the negative class).</li>
<li>A model that evaluates medical symptoms to determine whether a person
has a particular disease (the positive class) or doesn&#39;t have that
disease (the negative class).</li>
</ul>
