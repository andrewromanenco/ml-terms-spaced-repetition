The initial evaluation of a model&#39;s quality.
Validation checks the quality of a model&#39;s predictions against the
[[validation set|validation set]].

Because the validation set differs from the [[training set|training set]],
validation helps guard against [[overfitting|overfitting]].

You might think of evaluating the model against the validation set as the
first round of testing and evaluating the model against the
[[test set|test set]] as the second round of testing.
