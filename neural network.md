A [[model|model]] containing at least one
[[hidden layer|hidden layer]].
A [[deep neural network|deep neural network]] is a type of neural network
containing more than one hidden layer. For example, the following diagram
shows a deep neural network containing two hidden layers.

Each neuron in a neural network connects to all of the nodes in the next layer.
For example, in the preceding diagram, notice that each of the three neurons
in the first hidden layer separately connect to both of the two neurons in the
second hidden layer.

Neural networks implemented on computers are sometimes called
<strong>artificial neural networks</strong> to differentiate them from
neural networks found in brains and other nervous systems.

Some neural networks can mimic extremely complex nonlinear relationships
between different features and the label.
