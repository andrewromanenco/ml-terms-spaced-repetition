Given a classification problem with N classes, a
solution consisting of N separate
[[binary classification|binary classifiers]]â€”one binary classifier for
each possible outcome. For example, given a model that classifies examples
as animal, vegetable, or mineral, a one-vs.-all solution would provide the
following three separate binary classifiers:

<ul>
<li>animal versus not animal</li>
<li>vegetable versus not vegetable</li>
<li>mineral versus not mineral</li>
</ul>
