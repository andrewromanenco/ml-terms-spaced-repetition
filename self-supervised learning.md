A family of techniques for converting an
[[unsupervised machine learning|unsupervised machine learning]] problem
into a [[supervised machine learning|supervised machine learning]] problem
by creating surrogate [[label|labels]] from
[[unlabeled example|unlabeled examples]].

Some [[Transformer|Transformer]]-based models such as [[BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)|BERT]] use
self-supervised learning.

Self-supervised training is a
[[semi-supervised learning|semi-supervised learning]] approach.
