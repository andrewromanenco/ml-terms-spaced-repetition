A collection of [[model|models]] trained independently whose predictions
are averaged or aggregated. In many cases, an ensemble produces better
predictions than a single model. For example, a
[[random forest|random forest]] is an ensemble built from multiple
[[decision tree|decision trees]]. Note that not all
[[decision forest|decision forests]] are ensembles.
