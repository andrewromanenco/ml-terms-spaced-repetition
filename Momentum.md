A sophisticated gradient descent algorithm in which a learning step depends
not only on the derivative in the current step, but also on the derivatives
of the step(s) that immediately preceded it. Momentum involves computing an
exponentially weighted moving average of the gradients over time, analogous
to momentum in physics. Momentum sometimes prevents learning from getting
stuck in local minima.
