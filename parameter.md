The [[weight|weights]] and [[bias (math) or bias term|biases]] that a model learns during
[[training|training]]. For example, in a
[[linear regression|linear regression]] model, the parameters consist of
the bias (<em>b</em>) and all the weights (<i>w<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>w<sub>2</sub></i>,
and so on) in the following formula:

<div>
$$y' = b + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + â€¦ w_nx_n$$
</div>

In contrast, [[hyperparameter|hyperparameter]] are the values that
<em>you</em> (or a hyperparameter tuning service) supply to the model.
For example, [[learning rate|learning rate]] is a hyperparameter.
