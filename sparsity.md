The number of elements set to zero (or null) in a vector or matrix divided
by the total number of entries in that vector or matrix. For example,
consider a 100-element matrix in which 98 cells contain zero. The calculation of
sparsity is as follows:

<div>
$$
{\text{sparsity}} =
\frac{\text{98}} {\text{100}} =
{\text{0.98}}
$$
</div>

<strong>Feature sparsity</strong> refers to the sparsity of a feature vector;
<strong>model sparsity</strong> refers to the sparsity of the model weights.
