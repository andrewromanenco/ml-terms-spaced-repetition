In supervised learning, a [[classification model|classification]] problem
in which the dataset contains <em>more than two</em> [[class|classes]] of labels.
For example, the labels in the Iris dataset must be one of the following
three classes:

<ul>
<li>Iris setosa</li>
<li>Iris virginica</li>
<li>Iris versicolor</li>
</ul>

A model trained on the Iris dataset that predicts Iris type on new examples
is performing multi-class classification.

In contrast, classification problems that distinguish between exactly two
classes are [[binary classification|binary classification models]].
For example, an email model that predicts either <em>spam</em> or <em>not spam</em>
is a binary classification model.

In clustering problems, multi-class classification refers to more than
two clusters.
