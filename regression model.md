Informally, a model that generates a numerical prediction. (In contrast,
a [[classification model|classification model]] generates a class
prediction.) For example, the following are all regression models:

<ul>
<li>A model that predicts a certain house&#39;s value, such as 423,000 Euros.</li>
<li>A model that predicts a certain tree&#39;s life expectancy, such as 23.2 years.</li>
<li>A model that predicts the amount of rain that will fall in a certain city
over the next six hours, such as 0.18 inches.</li>
</ul>

Two common types of regression models are:

<ul>
<li>[[linear regression|Linear regression]], which finds the line that best
fits label values to features.</li>
<li>[[logistic regression|Logistic regression]], which generates a
probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that a system typically then maps to a class
prediction.</li>
</ul>

Not every model that outputs numerical predictions is a regression model.
In some cases, a numeric prediction is really just a classification model
that happens to have numeric class names. For example, a model that predicts
a numeric postal code is a classification model, not a regression model.
