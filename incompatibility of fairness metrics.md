#fairness

The idea that some notions of fairness are mutually incompatible and
cannot be satisfied simultaneously. As a result, there is no single
universal [[fairness metric|metric]] for quantifying fairness
that can be applied to all ML problems.

While this may seem discouraging, incompatibility of fairness metrics
doesn&#39;t imply that fairness efforts are fruitless. Instead, it suggests
that fairness must be defined contextually for a given ML problem, with
the goal of preventing harms specific to its use cases.

See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07236.pdf" target="T">&quot;On the
(im)possibility of fairness&quot;</a> for a more detailed discussion of this topic.
