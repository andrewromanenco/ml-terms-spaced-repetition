#rl

In [[reinforcement learning (RL)|reinforcement learning]],
the entity that uses a
[[policy|policy]] to maximize the expected [[return|return]] gained from
transitioning between [[state|states]] of the
[[environment|environment]].

More generally, an agent is software that autonomously plans and executes a
series of actions in pursuit of a goal, with the ability to adapt to changes
in its environment. For example, [[LLM|LLM]]-based agents might use the
LLM to generate a plan, rather than applying a reinforcement learning policy.
