A function that defines the frequency of samples less than or equal to a
target value. For example, consider a normal distribution of continuous values.
A CDF tells you that approximately 50% of samples should be less than or equal
to the mean and that approximately 84% of samples should be less than or equal
to one standard deviation above the mean.
