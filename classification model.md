A [[model|model]] whose prediction is a [[class|class]].
For example, the following are all classification models:

<ul>
<li>A model that predicts an input sentence&#39;s language (French? Spanish?
Italian?).</li>
<li>A model that predicts tree species (Maple? Oak? Baobab?).</li>
<li>A model that predicts the positive or negative class for a particular
medical condition.</li>
</ul>

In contrast, [[regression model|regression models]] predict numbers
rather than classes.

Two common types of classification models are:

<ul>
<li>[[binary classification|binary classification]]</li>
<li>[[multi-class classification|multi-class classification]]</li>
</ul>
