A [[regression model|regression model]] that uses not only the
[[weight|weights]] for each [[feature|feature]], but also the
uncertainty of those weights. A probabilistic regression model generates
a prediction and the uncertainty of that prediction. For example, a
probabilistic regression model might yield a prediction of 325 with a
standard deviation of 12. For more information about probabilistic regression
models, see this <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/examples/Probabilistic_Layers_Regression">Colab on
