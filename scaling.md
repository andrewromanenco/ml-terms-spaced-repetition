Any mathematical transform or technique that shifts the range of a label
and/or feature value. Some forms of scaling are very useful for transformations
like [[normalization|normalization]].

Common forms of scaling useful in Machine Learning include:

<ul>
<li>linear scaling, which typically uses a combination of subtraction and
division to replace the original value with a number between -1 and +1 or
between 0 and 1.</li>
<li>logarithmic scaling, which replaces the original value with its
logarithm.</li>
<li>[[Z-score normalization|Z-score normalization]], which replaces the
original value with a floating-point value representing the number of
standard deviations from that feature&#39;s mean.</li>
</ul>
