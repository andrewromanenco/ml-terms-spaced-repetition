#df

A set of scores that indicates the relative importance of each
[[feature|feature]] to the model.

For example, consider a [[decision tree|decision tree]] that
estimates house prices. Suppose this decision tree uses three
features: size, age, and style. If a set of variable importances
for the three features are calculated to be
{size=5.8, age=2.5, style=4.7}, then size is more important to the
decision tree than age or style.

Different variable importance metrics exist, which can inform
ML experts about different aspects of models.
