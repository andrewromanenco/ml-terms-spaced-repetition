A layer in a [[neural network|neural network]] between the
[[input layer|input layer]] (the features) and the
[[output layer|output layer]] (the prediction).
Each hidden layer consists of one or more [[neuron|neurons]].
For example, the following neural network contains two hidden layers,
the first with three neurons and the second with two neurons:

A [[deep neural network|deep neural network]] contains more than one
hidden layer. For example, the preceding illustration is a deep neural
network because the model contains two hidden layers.
