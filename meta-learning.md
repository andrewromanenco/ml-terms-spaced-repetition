#language

A subset of machine learning that discovers or improves a learning algorithm.
A meta-learning system can also aim to train a model to quickly learn a new
task from a small amount of data or from experience gained in previous tasks.
Meta-learning algorithms generally try to achieve the following:

<ul>
<li>Improve or learn hand-engineered features (such as an initializer or
an optimizer).</li>
<li>Be more data-efficient and compute-efficient.</li>
<li>Improve generalization.</li>
</ul>

Meta-learning is related to [[few-shot learning|few-shot learning]].
