#df

A tactic for training a [[decision forest|decision forest]] in which each
[[decision tree|decision tree]] considers only a random subset of possible
[[feature|features]] when learning the [[condition|condition]].
Generally, a different subset of features is sampled for each
[[node (neural network)|node]]. In contrast, when training a decision tree
without attribute sampling, all possible features are considered for each node.
