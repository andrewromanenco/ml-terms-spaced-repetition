#fairness

The fact that the frequency with which people write about actions,
outcomes, or properties is not a reflection of their real-world
frequencies or the degree to which a property is characteristic
of a class of individuals. Reporting bias can influence the composition
of data that machine learning systems learn from.

For example, in books, the word <em>laughed</em> is more prevalent than
<em>breathed</em>. A machine learning model that estimates the relative frequency of
laughing and breathing from a book corpus would probably determine
that laughing is more common than breathing.
