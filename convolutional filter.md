One of the two actors in a
[[convolutional operation|convolutional operation]]. (The other actor
is a slice of an input matrix.) A convolutional filter is a matrix having
the same [[rank (ordinality)|rank]] as the input matrix, but a smaller shape.
For example, given a 28x28 input matrix, the filter could be any 2D matrix
smaller than 28x28.

In photographic manipulation, all the cells in a convolutional filter are
typically set to a constant pattern of ones and zeroes. In machine learning,
convolutional filters are typically seeded with random numbers and then the
network [[training|trains]] the ideal values.
