Any automated process for building [[machine learning|machine learning]]
[[model|models]]. AutoML can automatically do tasks such as the following:

<ul>
<li>Search for the most appropriate model.</li>
<li>Tune [[hyperparameter|hyperparameters]].</li>
<li>Prepare data (including performing
[[feature engineering|feature engineering]]).</li>
<li>Deploy the resulting model.</li>
</ul>

AutoML is useful for data scientists because it can save them time and
effort in developing machine learning pipelines and improve prediction
accuracy. It is also useful to non-experts, by making complicated
machine learning tasks more accessible to them.
