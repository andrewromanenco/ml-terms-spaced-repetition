When [[neuron|neurons]] predict patterns in training data by relying
almost exclusively on outputs of specific other neurons instead of relying on
the network&#39;s behavior as a whole. When the patterns that cause co-adaptation
are not present in validation data, then co-adaptation causes overfitting.
[[dropout regularization|Dropout regularization]] reduces co-adaptation
because dropout ensures neurons cannot rely solely on specific other neurons.
