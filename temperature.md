#language, #image, #generativeAI

A [[hyperparameter|hyperparameter]] that controls the degree of randomness
of a model&#39;s output. Higher temperatures result in more random output,
while lower temperatures result in less random output.

Choosing the best temperature depends on the specific application and
the preferred properties of the model&#39;s output. For example, you would
probably raise the temperature when creating an application that
generates creative output. Conversely, you would probably lower the temperature
when building a model that classifies images or text in order to improve the
model&#39;s accuracy and consistency.

Temperature is often used with [[softmax|softmax]].
