#fundamentals

An example that contains [[feature|features]] but no [[label|label]].
For example, the following table shows three unlabeled examples from a house
valuation model, each with three features but no house value:

<table>
  <tr><th>Number of bedrooms</th> <th>Number of bathrooms</th>
      <th>House age</th> </tr>
  <tr><td>3</td> <td>2</td> <td>15</td> </tr>
  <tr><td>2</td> <td>1</td> <td>72</td> </tr>
  <tr><td>4</td> <td>2</td> <td>34</td> </tr>
</table>

In [[supervised machine learning|supervised machine learning]],
models train on labeled examples and make predictions on
[[unlabeled example|unlabeled examples]].

In [[semi-supervised learning|semi-supervised]] and
[[unsupervised machine learning|unsupervised]] learning,
unlabeled examples are used during training.

Contrast unlabeled example with [[labeled example|labeled example]].
