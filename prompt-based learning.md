#language, #generativeAI

A capability of certain [[model|models]] that enables them to adapt
their behavior in response to arbitrary text input ([[prompt|prompts]]).
In a typical prompt-based learning paradigm, a
[[large language model|large language model]] responds to a prompt by
generating text. For example, suppose a user enters the following prompt:

<blockquote>
Summarize Newton&#39;s Third Law of Motion.
</blockquote>

A model capable of prompt-based learning isn&#39;t specifically trained to answer
the previous prompt. Rather, the model &quot;knows&quot; a lot of facts about physics,
a lot about general language rules, and a lot about what constitutes generally
useful answers. That knowledge is sufficient to provide a (hopefully) useful
answer. Additional human feedback (&quot;That answer was too complicated.&quot; or
&quot;What&#39;s a reaction?&quot;) enables some prompt-based learning systems to gradually
improve the usefulness of their answers.
