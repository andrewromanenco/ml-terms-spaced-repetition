In [[recommendation system|recommendation systems]], an
[[embedding vector|embedding vector]] generated by
[[matrix factorization|matrix factorization]]
that holds latent signals about user preferences.
Each row of the user matrix holds information about the relative
strength of various latent signals for a single user.
For example, consider a movie recommendation system. In this system,
the latent signals in the user matrix might represent each user&#39;s interest
in particular genres, or might be harder-to-interpret signals that involve
complex interactions across multiple factors.

The user matrix has a column for each latent feature and a row for each user.
That is, the user matrix has the same number of rows as the target
matrix that is being factorized. For example, given a movie
recommendation system for 1,000,000 users, the
user matrix will have 1,000,000 rows.
