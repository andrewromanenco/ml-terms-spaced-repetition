If the event is a binary probability, then <b>odds</b> refers to
the ratio of the probability of success (<i>p</i>) to the probability of
failure (1-<i>p</i>). For example, suppose that a given event has a 90%
probability of success and a 10% probability of failure. In this case,
odds is calculated as follows:



<div>
$$
{\text{odds}} =
\frac{\text{p}} {\text{(1-p)}} =
\frac{.9} {.1} =
{\text{9}}
$$
</div>


The log-odds is simply the logarithm of the odds. By convention,
"logarithm" refers to
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm" target="T">natural logarithm</a>,
but logarithm could actually be any base greater than 1.
Sticking to convention, the log-odds of our example is therefore:

<div>
$$
{\text{log-odds}} =
ln(9) ~= 2.2
$$
</div>

The log-odds function is the inverse of the
