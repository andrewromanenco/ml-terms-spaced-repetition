The subset of the [[data set or dataset|dataset]] that performs initial
evaluation against a trained [[model|model]]. Typically, you evaluate
the trained model against the [[validation set|validation set]] several
times before evaluating the model against the [[test set|test set]].

Traditionally, you divide the examples in the dataset into the following three
distinct subsets:

<ul>
<li>a [[training set|training set]]</li>
<li>a validation set</li>
<li>a [[test set|test set]]</li>
</ul>

Ideally, each example in the dataset should belong to only one of the
preceding subsets. For example, a single example shouldn&#39;t belong to
both the training set and the validation set.
