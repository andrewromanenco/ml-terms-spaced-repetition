#fairness

Automatically making an association or assumption based on one&#39;s mind
models and memories. Implicit bias can affect the following:

<ul>
<li>How data is collected and classified.</li>
<li>How machine learning systems are designed and developed.</li>
</ul>

For example, when building a classifier to identify wedding photos,
an engineer may use the presence of a white dress in a photo as a feature.
However, white dresses have been customary only during certain eras and
in certain cultures.
