The algorithm that determines the ideal [[model|model]] for
[[inference|inference]] in [[model cascading|model cascading]].
A model router is itself typically a machine learning model that
gradually learns how to pick the best model for a given input.
However, a model router could sometimes be a simpler,
non-machine learning algorithm.
