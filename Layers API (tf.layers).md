#TensorFlow

A TensorFlow API for constructing a [[deep model|deep]] neural network
as a composition of layers. The Layers API lets you build different
types of [[layer|layers]], such as:

<ul>
<li><code translate="no" dir="ltr">tf.layers.Dense</code> for a [[fully connected layer|fully-connected layer]].</li>
<li><code translate="no" dir="ltr">tf.layers.Conv2D</code> for a convolutional layer.</li>
</ul>

The Layers API follows the [[Keras|Keras]] layers API conventions.
That is, aside from a different prefix, all functions in the Layers API
have the same names and signatures as their counterparts in the Keras
layers API.
