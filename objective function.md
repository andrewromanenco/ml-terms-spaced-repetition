The mathematical formula or [[metric|metric]] that a model aims to optimize.
For example, the objective function for
[[linear regression|linear regression]] is usually
[[Mean Squared Error (MSE)|Mean Squared Loss]]. Therefore, when training a
linear regression model, training aims to minimize Mean Squared Loss.

In some cases, the goal is to <em>maximize</em> the objective function.
For example, if the objective function is accuracy, the goal is
to maximize accuracy.
