#recsystems

The initial set of recommendations chosen by a
[[recommendation system|recommendation system]]. For example, consider a
bookstore that offers 100,000 titles. The candidate generation phase creates
a much smaller list of suitable books for a particular user, say 500. But even
500 books is way too many to recommend to a user. Subsequent, more expensive,
phases of a recommendation system (such as [[scoring|scoring]] and
[[re-ranking|re-ranking]]) reduce those 500 to a much smaller,
more useful set of recommendations.
